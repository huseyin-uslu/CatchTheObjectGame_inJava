## Why did I make this game ?

- First things first , this was made for education and enjoyment. 
- Even though I deeply thought how to find a game for children to be got used to software and coding , I couldn't find any content on the internet.
- After that I decided to make a game by myself and that's it. This completely belongs to me.

## Why did I make this game using java?

-Actually I tried to use a game engine LibGdx but I found it a little bit messy so that I decided to use a powerful language "java" I think this is the best choice for an android game. 

### This game can be developed by everyone I permit everyone to develop this app.

I'll keep updating this game as long as I'm inspired of around me.
